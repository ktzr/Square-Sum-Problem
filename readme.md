Inspired by : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1m7goLCJDY


Check whether sequence of numbers [1..n] can be arranged such that any two sequential numbers sum to a square number.   

The problem ends up being
 
 * Find the undirected graph such that any two vertices with an edge sum to a square number.
 * Find a hamiltonian path though the graph.
